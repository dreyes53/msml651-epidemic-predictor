# Hybrid Model Using XGBoost + GRU

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project implements a **hybrid machine learning model** that combines **XGBoost (gradient boosting)** for structured feature extraction and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)** for time-series forecasting. The model is designed to improve prediction accuracy for sequential datasets.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Clone Repository
First, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dreyes53/msml651-epidemic-predictor
cd msml651-epidemic-predictor
```

## Running the Model
To run the models, run the Jupyter notebook **`MSML651_final.ipynb`** locally or on Google Colab, you might need some GPU.
