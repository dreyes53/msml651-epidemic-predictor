# Hybrid Model Using XGBoost + GRU

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project implements a **hybrid machine learning model** that combines **XGBoost (gradient boosting)** for structured feature extraction and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)** for time-series forecasting. The model is designed to improve prediction accuracy for sequential datasets.

## ðŸš€ Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
